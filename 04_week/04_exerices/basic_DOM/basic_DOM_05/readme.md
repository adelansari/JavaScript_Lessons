# Build a Pancake Maker with Dynamic Pricing

Objective: Implement JavaScript functionality for a pancake customization tool that dynamically updates the price based on user selections, such as pancake type, toppings, and extras. HTML and CSS are provided; your task is to add the JavaScript to make it interactive.

Your task is to write the JavaScript code that:

1. Listens for changes on the pancake type select box and all checkbox inputs.
2. Calculates the total price based on selections:
   - Pancake type has a base price.
   - Each topping adds $1 to the base price.
   - Extras have their specific prices.
3. Displays the dynamically updated total price in the #totalPrice span.

Use the `addEventListener` method for listening to changes and the `forEach` method for iterating through checkbox inputs to calculate the total price. Remember to parse checkbox values as integers before adding them to the total.

# Optional Enhancements

- Integrate a font from Google Fonts to apply to all elements on the page. Select a font that aligns with the modern and appealing aesthetic of the project.
- Adjust the pancake image to cover 50% of the page and extend to full viewport height, creating a visually striking layout.
- Implement a captivating animation for the price display to draw attention to price changes.
- Ensure your application looks great on both desktop and mobile devices by employing responsive design techniques.
